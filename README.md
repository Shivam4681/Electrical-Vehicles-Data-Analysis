## Project Overview 
This repository contains my Electric Vehicle (EV) Analysis project created using Power BI. The goal of this project is to explore and visualize EV sales data to uncover trends and insights. I am continuously improving this dashboard, and here’s an overview of what I’ve done so far:<br>

1. Data Import and Exploration:<br>
• Imported the EV sales dataset (CSV format) into Power BI.<br>
• Explored the dataset in Table View to understand its structure — number of rows, columns, and data types.<br>
• Checked for missing values and ensured data quality.<br>

2. Data Understanding:<br>
• Analyzed the dataset and identified key metrics to visualize relevant EV market trends.<br>

3. Visualizations:<br>
• Total Vehicles by Model: Bar chart showing the number of vehicles sold per model.<br>
• Total Vehicles by EV Type: Pie chart representing vehicles by type:<br>
   • Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV)
   • Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV)
• Top 10 Vehicles by Make: Chart highlighting the top 10 vehicle brands by total sales; Tesla leads the list.<br>
• Total Vehicles by Model Year: Area chart showing yearly EV sales trends.<br>
• Count of VIN Numbers by Year and Make: Visualization of unique Vehicle Identification Numbers registered by year and brand.<br>
• Total Vehicles by CAFV Eligibility: Donut chart showing eligibility for Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle incentives:<br>
   • Dark blue: Eligible <br>
   • Blue: Unknown eligibility <br>
   • Orange: Not eligible <br>


4. KPIs (Key Performance Indicators):<br>
• FKPI cards displaying:<br>
   • Average vehicle range <br>
   • Total number of vehicles <br>
   • Total number of EVs <br>
   • Number of unique makes <br>


5. Interactive Slicers<br>
• Added slicers to filter and explore the data by:<br>
   • Model Year <br>
   • State <br>
   • Vehicle Make (brand) <br>
